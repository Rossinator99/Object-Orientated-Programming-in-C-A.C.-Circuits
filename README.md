# Object-Orientated-Programming-in-C-A.C.-Circuits
A program that simulates AC circuits using object orientated programming in C++ and standard libraries.
The program allows nested parallel and series circuits with five components: transistor, diode, resistor, inductors and capacitor. 
The complex impedance and phase difference are calculated for each component and nested circuits. 
Subsequently, the overall impedance and current are calculated for the entire circuit.
